```{r setup, include=FALSE}
setwd("C:/statistics/R/repositories/BIOL432_A1/BIOL432_A1/")
MData<- read.csv("measurements.csv")
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)

ShortData<- MData %>% 
  mutate(Sp = sub("([A-Z])[^ ]*(.*)", "\\1.\\2", Species)) %>%
  select(Sp, everything(), -Species)
print(ShortData)
```
The above code includes:
[A-Z] which captures the first letter of the genus
[^ ]* which matches zero or more characters that are not spaces
(.*) which matches the species (everything after the space)
\\1. which replaces the matched text with the first letter of the genus followed by a period
\\2 which replaces the matched text with the species name
```{r}
write.csv(ShortData, "ShortData.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
